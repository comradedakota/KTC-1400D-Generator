title: Galaxy Workflow Plotter
---

This past week I was frustrated "for the last time" by having to take multiple
screenshots and stitch them together to plot a galaxy workflow. I knew I could
do better...

Thus, I spent the week working on this mildly useless tool to plot workflows as
slightly prettier & more succict graphics.
