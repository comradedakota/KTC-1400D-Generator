# About me

I do bioinformatics, systems administration, software development, and a
bit of cyber for the Center for Phage Technology at TAMU.


## Projects and Work

I'm one of the community developers of the [Galaxy Project](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy)
a scientific workflow management system dedicated to bringing accessible
bioinformatics to all.

My work projects cover a wide range of topics, from standard bioinformatics
analyses for researchers in my organisation, to developing novel systems to
solve infrastructure problems for the greater bioinformatics community.

The primary goal of all of my work is to make lives easier and more
efficient. I aim to isolate and remove pain points from human-computer
interactions. If, by dedicating hours of my time, my coworkers can click a
single button and go home to their family, I consider my job accomplished.
Naturally, I live by this graphic:

I'm an extreme F/OSS advocate; all of my work is F/OSS, and the vast majority of my projects are available under GPLv3 or AGPLv3
