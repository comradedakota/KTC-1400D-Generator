blurb: efficiency with your back to the wall

have 14 tabs open, on my mobile browser. 
cause for alarm, I don't remember
the last time it was below 90.

have had to streamline lately. no time,
no  for inefficiencies. read it? short now sure. long maybe later or never. decide. decide. decide. stick it in linkwarden, maybe that'll show up in my feeds on my tablet.

such limited energy, such limited time. apologies for delayed responses, expect delays on the order of a fiscal year.

not sick, just, time is fully fully occupied, there's nothing left to spare. What's left is for the partner and no one else.

there'll be a plateau, eventually. (I hope).

where I'm efficient enough to claw back some energy.

off mission tasks? off topic tabs? things that don't get me to my goals? delete. delete. delete.

there's so much more reading. I don't know about it today, but I'll be an expert tomorrow. papers have to be digested, faster faster faster.

good thing I'm an expert level reader.

abstract conclusion discussion method. no, abstract figures conclusion method. no.

reading straight through because the introduction is brand new, and reading all of them written in several ways is more efficient for forcing the knowledge down.

decide. delete. faster.
