title: Galaxy Workflow Plotter
draft: true
repo: erasche/galaxy-workflow-plotter

This past week I was frustrated "for the last time" by having to take multiple
screenshots and stitch them together to plot a galaxy workflow. I knew I could
do better...

Thus, I spent the week working on this mildly useless tool to plot workflows as
slightly prettier & more succict graphics.

<div class="pure-g well">
	<div class="pure-u-1">
		<div class="l-box well-title">
			Workflow Plotter
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="pure-u-1">
		<img src="/assets/img/gwp.png" width="100%" />
	</div>
	<div class="pure-u-1">
		<div class="l-box">
			Image of the GWP
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
