blurb: The art for my thesis is made known
---

The only thing worse than "programmer art" as it is fondly known is probably "engineer art". It's in its own special class of bad, where the artist cares more about nice round numbers in their SVG file than the end result. In the past 6 years the only inkscape skill they've developed is a better understanding of "snap to corner"

Thus, I have turned over art for my thesis to one of the Machine Learning Models (MidJourney v4). It was this, programmer art, or nothing. No artist is losing a commission over my use of MJ, and I'm not using the style of any specific artist intentionally, rather just the amalgamation of "ink".
