          VideoJS plugin that adds buttons to step through a video by 1 and 5
          frames (configurable). It's my most starred repo and I kind of hate
          it, it only gets stars because it's javascript. Anyone could have
          written this, it isn't exciting code. Why do y'all like this so much?
